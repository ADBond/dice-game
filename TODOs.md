# Things to fix

These are *mostly* (but not exclusively) things that are broken, rather than just not implemented yet.
Generally stuff that I could easily forget when I next come back to this.

* ~~Can overwrite scores~~
* ~~If dice are held, they stay don't roll when we start a new game~~
* Messages don't show up when relevant
* ~~Messages make the rest of the stuff jump about~~
* ~~New game should maybe have a warning (esp. if game is still going)~~
* ~~Roll again button should look more change appearance/text after entering a score~~
* ~~Some prompt to select a score after 3 rolls~~
* Scores should be buttons and feel a bit nicer interacting with
* Currently no strong indication when game ends
* Implement subsequent yahtzees/wildcard behaviour?
* ~~Can hold on roll zero still~~
* ~~(layout needs fixing)~~
* layout needs improving
* New game after roll #3 doesn't re-roll dice to start

## devvier

* Make it more standard - e.g. remove snake case, check for other bad practices like `var`, `==` etc
* A bunch of elements have classes that should really be ids
* More sensible structuring of classes, which functions are static, etc
* Split up main file into several smaller modules
* Check out stuff like minifying etc
* Maybe some light testing, just to catch any really stupid bits
