# Things to fix

These are *mostly* (but not exclusively) things that are broken, rather than just not implemented yet.
Generally stuff that I could easily forget when I next come back to this.

* Can overwrite scores
* If dice are held, they stay don't roll when we start a new game
* Messages don't show up when relevant
* Messages make the rest of the stuff jump about
* New game should maybe have a warning (esp. if game is still going)
* Roll again button should look more change appearance/text after entering a score
* Some prompt to select a score after
* (layout needs fixing)
